# 🧠 AI vs Human Content Detection  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to distinguish between **AI-generated text** and **Human-written content** using **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** and **Machine Learning models**.  

With the rise of AI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and others, detecting AI-generated content has become critical for:  
- 📚 Academic integrity  
- 📰 Journalism & Media authenticity  
- 🔍 Plagiarism and originality checking

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset contains labeled text samples from **AI generators** and **human writers**.  
Each entry includes:  
- **Text content**  
- **Label** (`AI` = 1, `Human` = 0)  

---

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

Key insights from the dataset:  

### 1️⃣ Class Distribution  
Balanced dataset with both AI and Human samples.

### 2️⃣ Readability Scores  
AI text often shows lower variance in readability scores compared to human text.

### 3️⃣ Confusion Matrix (Final Model)  
Our final trained model achieved strong classification accuracy.

## 🤖 Modeling  

We trained and evaluated multiple ML models:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- LightGBM  

After tuning, **XGBoost** gave the best balance of precision and recall.  
The trained model is saved as **`best_model.pkl`**.

## ⚙️ Installation  

Clone the repository and install dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-vs-Human-Content-Detection.git
cd AI-vs-Human-Content-Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage  

You can run predictions directly from the command line using `main.py`:  

```bash
python main.py "This is a sample text to check if AI wrote it."
```

---

## 📌 Example Run  

```bash
python main.py "This text is generated by an AI."
```
**Output:**  
```
Predicted: AI
```

```bash
python main.py "I love writing stories late at night with a cup of tea."
```
**Output:**  
```
Predicted: Human
```

## 📈 Results  

- **Accuracy:** ~XX% (update with your final score)  
- **Best Model:** XGBoost  
- **Key Finding:** AI-generated text tends to have lower lexical diversity and more uniform structure compared to human text.
